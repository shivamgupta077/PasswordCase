# PasswordCase

This is an application intended for a user to store and manage all his/her passwords at one place, itself protected by a password. It has a functionality of having the password in protected format and a button to copy the password directly to the clipboard and then being able to copy it directly to the password box of different sites. 2-step authentication is added so that passwords cannot be leaked easily even if users master password is leaked.
